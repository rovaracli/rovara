// S3 review M-5: a step's fence tripping must never drop the step silently. The core's step start (vendor core/task-flow/stage-machine.ts `acceptStep`) puts the items `checkStep` returned into the
// step's own transaction; when one fails and nothing else explains it, it answers `STALE`, which a dispatch row reads as "no longer wanted" and drops, leaving a task that waits for a step nobody
// will start. A fence that tripped is not that: the person's role, grant or the task's People changed since the check, and the check must be asked again. So the items `checkStep` returns are marked
// here, and a transaction that fails on a marked item throws a retryable error instead: the dispatch row is rescheduled (it asks `checkStep` again, which passes with a fresh fence or refuses with
// its reason, and the workflow is blocked with that reason, visibly), and after the sweep's attempts are used up the owner reads that the step could not start. Nothing else about the store changes.
