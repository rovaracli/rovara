// The nightly run's result route, broker side (NH-1): `POST /v1/internal/workspaces/{w}/operations/{o}/nightly-result`, the ONE action a nightly run's worker has to report with.
//
// The slot id is not a secret (the scheduler's input names it), so nothing about WHO may record is read from the body. The caller is authenticated the way every operation callback is, and then held to the
// same rules the setup run's callback is held to:
//   - the capability (`nightly-result`) was granted by the broker to the verification operation of a nightly task, and carries the operation's fence (a stale fence is refused before this runs);
//   - the operation is RUNNING, is a task operation in verification mode, and its workspace's task is a `nightly_run` task of the operation's company that is still open: the org and the project come
//     from that task, never from the body;
//   - the result is accepted only for what that task was started to run: the same slot, environment revision, branch and commit, all four. A result for another slot, another revision or another commit,
//     from a worker that holds a valid capability for its own run, is refused and changes nothing.
// Everything else (the lock the slot holds, the clock, the coverage map's digest, the classification and the project's health) is `recordNightlyResultWithHealth`'s own. With `nh` or the test environment
// off, the route answers CALLBACK_FORBIDDEN and nothing is read.
