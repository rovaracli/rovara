// Convergence lane A4 (cloud/ec2-machines): Cloud's EC2 adapter on Rovara Code's `WorkerMachines` port.
//
// A machine is one ec2-ebs workspace's compute, exactly as Cloud runs it today: `start` is `SessionManager.ensureSession` (which starts the
// session provisioner state machine: the launch template, the boot user data from session-steps, the qualified AMI pin, the workspace volume),
// `stop` ends the instance and keeps the volume (what the idle reaper does), `terminate` is `SessionManager.deleteSession` (the deleter: instance
// and volume), `health` reads the SESSION item and the worker's /ping, and `deliver` signs the same invoke token the dispatcher signs today and
// posts it to the same worker port. The adapter never calls RunInstances itself and never writes user data, an instance profile, a network or a
// metadata setting: everything a worker can do is still fixed by the provisioner and the launch template (owner decision 65: no new worker power).
//
// One adapter serves one company. Every call reads which company the workspace belongs to and treats a machine of any other company as one that
// does not exist: it is never started, stopped, ended, asked about or handed a job through this company's adapter.
