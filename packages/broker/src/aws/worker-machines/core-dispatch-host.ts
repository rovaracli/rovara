// Convergence lane A4 (cloud/ec2-machines): the dispatcher Lambda as the host of Rovara Code's `runDispatchOnce`.
//
// Cloud's dispatcher is fed by SQS through a Lambda event source mapping, so it never polls: the batch arrives in the event. The core's dispatch
// consumer receives from a `Queue`. This module joins the two: the batch's core dispatch messages (`{ v: 1, workspaceId, operationId }`, what the
// core's outbox stages) are served to `runDispatchOnce` as a queue that holds exactly those records, once each, and what the core does with each one
// becomes the Lambda's answer for it:
//   - ack:               the record is done (Lambda deletes it);
//   - changeVisibility:  the record is hidden for that long (SQS ChangeMessageVisibility) and reported as a batch item failure, so it comes back then;
//   - deadLetter:        handed to the dead-letter function when there is one; otherwise reported as a failure and left to the queue's redrive policy;
//   - nothing at all:    reported as a failure (a fault the core did not model): a record is never dropped unless the core acknowledged it.
//
// The claim and the signature stay in the dispatcher's role (convergence plan, ledger row worker-machines): the core claims the operation (fenced) before
// it builds anything, and the machines adapter signs with the KMS key only this role may use.
//
// It is off unless the switch says otherwise, and an off host takes no record: the batch goes through today's path unchanged.
