// Learning v2 L1: the reflector's input, built by code and never chosen by a model (design §4.5.1, controls C1, C3, C5).
//   - Outsider spans are removed here, before any model call (C1). A task started or steered by an outsider, or whose intent came from one, is
//     ineligible for lessons (MINJA): only its structured outcomes count elsewhere.
//   - A member's quoted, forwarded or pasted text is treated as its unknown author's, which is an outsider (C3).
//   - Every span is cleaned (secrets redacted, hidden characters and markup removed) and datamarked with an id and its trust class (C5, spotlighting).
//   - Every span that reaches the prompt counts for the lesson's trust and audience, whether or not the model cites it (see reflect.ts): the model
//     cannot launder a restricted or low-trust span by choosing which evidence to name.
//   - Human edits to a pull request (decision Q5) are read from the PR at merge by the caller and arrive here as in-memory spans. They are never stored;
//     the lesson keeps only a link to the PR.
